During this code lab, we will present how a typical Video Player application can be enhanced
to support cast. To this end, we have broken the process into smaller pieces so participants
can go through them and get a first-hand experience while doing that.

To support this approach, a number of in-between milestones/projects have been prepared. Here is
brief description of each project:

Scope of Project 0
------------------
Provides a functional local video player that allows user to

- Browse through a list of videos hosted remotely
- Play any of the videos locally

In this step, there is no Cast related functionality.


Scope of Project 1
------------------
In this milestone, we

- add CCL
- add Cast button to both activities
- make it possible to connect to and disconnect from a cast device (no remote playback yet).


Scope of Project 2
------------------
In this milestone, we add the following:
- Ability to play a video on a cast device, supporting both "Play then Connect" and
  "Connect then Play"
- Add a full screen remote control activity

By the end of this project, you have a functional cast enabled video app that can play locally
and remotely. The app, however, is not yet fully UX Compliant.


Scope of Project 3
------------------
In this step, we start making our cast-enabled app compliant with the UX Checklist. We will
add support for

- Global mini player
- Cling (introductory UI)
- Closed Caption + Preferences


Scope of Project 4
------------------
In this last step, we start complete making our cast-enabled app compliant with the UX Checklist.
We will add support for

- Notifications
- Lock Screen Controls
- Reconnection Logic
- Handling cast volume control inside and outside the app
